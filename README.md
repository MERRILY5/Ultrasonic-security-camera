### Project Description: Ultrasonic Motion Detection Camera

This project involves the creation of an ultrasonic motion detection camera using OpenCV and Flask. The camera captures live video feed, detects faces using a Haar cascade classifier, and streams the processed video over a web interface. Here are the key components and functionalities:

1. **Libraries and Tools**:
   - **OpenCV**: For video capture, image processing, and face detection.
   - **Flask**: For setting up the web server and rendering the video stream on a web page.

2. **Face Detection**:
   - Uses OpenCV's pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for detecting faces in real-time.
   - Converts the captured frames to grayscale for face detection.
   - Draws rectangles around detected faces on the video frames.

3. **Video Capture and Processing**:
   - Captures video from the default camera using OpenCV.
   - Continuously reads frames from the camera, processes them for face detection, and encodes them for streaming.

4. **Web Server Setup**:
   - **Flask** is used to create a simple web server.
   - **Index Route** (`/`): Serves the main HTML page (`index.html`) which contains the video feed.
   - **Video Feed Route** (`/video_feed`): Streams the processed video frames to the web page using Flask's `Response` object with a MIME type suitable for video streaming.

5. **Real-time Streaming**:
   - The `generate` function continuously captures and processes frames, yielding them as byte-encoded JPEG images.
   - The `video_feed` route uses this generator to stream the video in real-time.

### Usage:
- **Run the Flask Server**: Start the server using `python app.py`, which will host the application on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.
- **Access the Web Interface**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://<your-ip-address>:8000` to view the live video feed with face detection.

This project demonstrates the integration of computer vision techniques with web technologies to create a real-time, web-accessible motion detection and face recognition system.
